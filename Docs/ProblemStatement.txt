Problem Statement of ADS
========================

Advantis Dental Surgeries, LLC (ADS) is a company that is in the business of managing a
growing network of dental surgeries which are located across cities in the South West
region. Assume you have been hired by the company, as a Lead Software Engineer and
tasked to lead the effort in designing and developing a web-based software solution (i.e. a
website) which the company will be using to manage their business.

The system will be used by an Office Manager to register Dentists who apply to join their
network of dental surgeries. Each Dentist is given a unique ID number and their First Name,
Last Name, Contact Phone Number, Email and Specialization are recorded in the system.
The Office Manager also uses the system to enroll new Patients who require dental services,
including the Patient’s First Name, Last Name, Contact Phone Number, Email, Mailing
Address and Date of Birth. A Patient can call in to request an appointment to see a dentist. A
Patients can also request an appointment by submitting an online form on the ADS website.
Upon receiving a request for an appointment, the Office Manager can then book the
appointment and the system will send a confirmation email notifying the Patient, and the
appointment gets recorded accordingly.

Dentists should be able to sign-in to the system and view a listing of all their Appointments,
including details of the Patients whom they have been scheduled to see. Each appointment is
normally made for a specific date and time and the dentist is expected to see/treat the
patient at one of ADS’s surgery locations. The system should provide information about
each Surgery, including its name, location address and telephone number. Patients should
be able to sign-in to the system and view their appointments, including the information of
the dentist who they have been booked to see. Patients should also be able to request to
cancel or change their appointments.

A dentist cannot be given more than 5 appointments in any given week. The system should
prevent a Patient from requesting a new appointment if they have an outstanding, unpaid
bill for dental services they have received.
